Time to wrap up this little game once and for all. A few guards patrol the area at night but not many â€” after all, very few know this place even exists.\\n\\tOur quarters are arranged away from the main house; where we sleep is of less importance than where we work. We each have our own hut, through some are less permanent than others. Hooper\\'s is a military issue tent: quite a large canopy, with two rooms inside and a short porch area where he insists people leave their shoes. It\\'s all zipped up for the night and no light shines from inside.\\n\\tI hang back for a moment. If Harris is keeping to the terms of our deal then someone will be watching this place. But I can see noâ€”one.\\n\\t * (outer_zip) [Open the outer zip] \\n\\t\\t \\tI creep forward to the tent, intent on lifting the zip to the front porch area just a little â€” enough to slip the component inside, and without the risk of the noise waking Hooper from his snoring.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe work is careful, and more than little fiddly â€” Hooper has tied the zips down on the inside, the fastidious little bastard! â€” but after a little work I manage to make a hole large enough for my hand.\\n\\t\\t\\t* * [Slip in the component] \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI slide the component into the tent, work the zip closed, and move quickly away into the shadows. It takes a few minutes for my breath to slow, and my heart to stop hammering, but I see no other movement. If anyone is watching Hooper\\'s tent, they are asleep at their posts.\\n\\t\\t\\t* * [No, some other way] \\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen pause. This is too transparent. Too blatant. If I leave it here, like this, Hooper will never be seen to go looking for it: he will stumble over it in plain sight, and the men watching will wonder why it was not there when he went to bed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNo, I must try something else â€” or nothing at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * \\t[On top of the tent] -> put_component_on_tent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * \\t[Throw the component into the long grass] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\tFrom inspiration â€” or desperation, I am not certain â€” a simple approach occurs to me. -> toss_component_into_bushes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * \\t[Give up] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is nothing to be gained here.

The men watching Hooper will know it is a deception and Hooper\\'s protestations will be taken at face value.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf I can\\'t find a way for Hooper to pick the component up, as if from a hiding place of his own devising, and be caught doing it, then I have no plan at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * [Return to my barrack] -> return_to_room_after_excursion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * [Escape the compound] -> live_on_the_run\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t* * * [Toss the component into the bushes] -> toss_component_into_bushes\\n\\t * [Hide the component somewhere] \\n\\t \\t\\tIf I leave the component here somewhere it should be somewhere I can rely on Hooper finding it, but noâ€”one before Hooper.

If I could place it on top of the canvas, somewhere in the middle where it would bow the cloth inwards, then it would be invisible to anyone passing by. But to Hooper, it would be above him: a shadow staring him in the face as he awoke. What could be more natural than getting up, coming out, and looking to see what had fallen on him during the night?\\n\\tIt\\'s the work of a moment. I was once an excellent bowler for the second XI back at school.

How could a man like Harris understand?\\n\\tThe Commander takes one look back from the doorway as he pulls it to.\\n\\t\"It\\'s been a pleasure working with you, Mr Manning,\" he declares. \"You\\'ve done a great service to this country. If we come through, I\\'m sure they\\'ll remember you name. I\\'m sorry it had to end this way and I\\'ll do my best to keep it quiet. Noâ€”one need know what you did.\"\\n=== all_too_farfetched\\n\\t\"This is all too farâ€”fetched,\" Harris says. \"I\\'m glad to have this back, but I need to think.\"\\n\\tGetting to his feet, he nods once. \"You\\'ll have to wait a little longer, I\\'m afraid, Manning.\"\\n\\tThen he steps out of the door, muttering to himself.\\n=== left_alone\\n\\t{ slam_door_shut_and_gone.time_to_move_now :The Commander holds the door for his superior, and follows him out.} Then the door closes. I am alone again, as I have been for most of my short life.\\n=== make_your_peace\\n\\t* [Make your peace]\\n\\t-\\tI am waiting again. I have no God to make my peace with. I find it difficult to believe in goodness of any kind, in a world such as this. \\n \\t\\t{ not notraitor:\\n\\t\\t\\tBut I am no traitor. Not to my country. To my sex, perhaps. But how could I support the Reich? If the Nazis were to come to power, I would be worse off than ever.\\n\\t\\t}\\t\\n \\t\\t{ harris_threatens_lynching.too_clever:\\n\\t\\t\\tIn truth, it is men like Harris who are complex, not men like me. I live to make things ordered, systematic. I like my pencils sharpened and lined up in a row. I do not deal in difficult borders, or uncertainties, or alliances. If I could, I would reduce the world to something easier to understand, something finite. \\n\\t\\t\\tBut I cannot, not even here, in our little haven from the horrors of the war.\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tI have no place here. No way to fit. I am caught, in the middle, cryptic and understood only thinly, through my machines. \\n \\t\\t\\t* \\tI must seem very calm. \\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\t* \\tPerhaps I should try to escape.[] But escape to where? I am already a prisoner. Jail would be a blessing. -> monastic\\n\\t- \\t<> I suppose I do not believe they will hang me. They will lock me up and continue to use my brain, if they can. I wonder what they will tell the world â€” perhaps that I have taken my own life. That would be simplest. The few who know me would believe it.\\n\\t\\tWell, then. Not a bad existence, in prison. Removed from temptation. \\n\\t-\\t(monastic) A monastic life, with plenty of problems to keep me going. \\n\\t\\tI wonder what else I might yet unravel before I\\'m done?\\n \\t\\t\\t* The door is opening.[] Harris is returning. Our little calculation here is complete. { not piecereturned: I can only hope one of the others will be able to explain to him that the part I stole will mean nothing to the Germans.|We are just pieces in this machine; interchangeable and prone to wear.}\\n\\t- \\tThat is the true secret of the calculating engine, and the source of its power. It is not the components that matter, they are quite repetitive. What matters is how they are wired; the diversity of the patterns and structures they can form. Much like people â€” it is how they connect that determines our victories and tragedies, and not their genius.\\n\\t\\tWhich makes me wonder. Should I give { i_met_a_young_man :up my beautiful young man|the young man who put me in this spot} to them as well as myself?\\n\\t\\t * \\t[Yes] \\n\\t\\t \\t\\tBut of course I will. { forceful > 2:Perhaps I can persuade them to put him in my cell.|A little vengeance, disguised as doing something good.}\\n\\t\\t * \\t[No] \\n\\t\\t \\t\\tNo. What would be the use? He will be long gone, and the name he told me is no doubt hokum. No: I was alone before in guilt, and I am thus alone again.\\n\\t\\t * \\t[Lie] \\n\\t\\t \\t\\tNo. Why would I? He is no doubt an innocent himself, trapped by some dire circumstance. Forced to act the way he did. I have every sympathy for him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOf course I do.\\n\\t\\t * \\t[Evade] \\n\\t\\t \\t\\tIt depends, perhaps, on what his name his worth. If it were to prove valuable, well; perhaps I can concoct a few more such lovers with which to ease my later days.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{ hooper_mentioned: Hooper, perhaps. He wouldn\\'t like that. }\\n\\t- \\t{ not longgrasshooperframe  :\\n\\t\\t\\tHarris put the cuffs around my wrists. \"I still have the intercept in my pocket,\" I remark. \"Wherever we\\'re going, could I have a pencil?\"\\n\\t\\t- else:\\n\\t\\t\\t\"We recovered the part, just where you said it was,\" Harris reports, as he puts the cuffs around my wrists. \"Of course, a couple of the men swear blind they searched there yesterday, so I\\'m afraid, what with the broken window... we\\'ve formed a perfectly good theory which doesn\\'t bode well for you.\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t{ longgrasshooperframe  :\\n\\t\\t\"I see.\" It doesn\\'t seem worth arguing any further. \"I still have the intercept in my pocket,\" I remark. \"Wherever we\\'re going, could I have a pencil?\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tHe looks me in the eye.\\n\\t\\t{ not losttemper  :\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Of course.
